Tamei
=====

`Tamei (Hebrew adjective, "ritually impure")` :)

Tamei is a very simple project, it splits common lisp into 6 packages:

- **pure forms:** functions or macros that do not modify the inputs or perform visible flow control, and that only operate on their arguments. e.g. > equal sqrt
- **impure forms:** function or macros that mutate their input in any way, or rely on data other than from it's arguments, EXCLUDING IO, because we are keeping that in the next package. e.g. nconc, setf
- **IO forms:** also impure but because they perform IO they are in their own package.
- **top level forms:** all forms that, according to the spec, are only meant to be used at the top level
- **pure flow control:** control flow forms where the jumps are within the form only e.g. if, case
- **impure flow control:** forms which can cause a jump outside of itself. e.g. abort, return

It does not add/remove any features to/from common lisp. It purely exists to differentiate.

Notes on progress
=================
Issues over the concept have be raised and are interesting. These include:
- Categorising over purity is a mistake as destructive things can be used purely (nconc on freshly cons'd lists)
- "Does binding count as meta-level side-effects? Binding of top-level variables? Binding of special variables? Binding of lexical variables? Handling conditions?"

I like these and while I will be continuing on this, I do need to come up with better categorizations. This doesnt slow this project down as recategorising will be easier once this initial work is done.



Want to contribute?
===================
That's awesome! thankyou. The best way for us to get this done quickly is the following

- Fork the repo
- Raise an issue (on this repo) saying which batch you want to complete. This makes sure we don't duplicate each other's work.
- For each symbol in your chosen batch look at the hyperspec to see if it is top level define, pure or impure and add the export for the symbol to the correct package.
- Remove the batch you chose from the `Symbols still to categorize` list below
- Create a pull request referencing the issue.
- I'll close the issue after pulling in the change.

If you symbol does not fit one of the categories please add it symbol to the `other.md` file.

Exceptions are so woven into the fabric of the language that to treat them as impure would mean no functions would be considered pure. To this end I only treat functions whose primary purpose is related to exceptions to be impure.

The symbols only refer to functions and macros, any collision with restarts, format symbols etc are coincidental and not relevent to this project

Be as harsh as possible, if it is 'almost always pure EXCEPT when x' then it is impure. If it is 'impure but can also do IO' then it's an IO form. If it can jump local but can also jump outside itself then it's impure flow control. You get the idea :)

Dont like the categories?
=========================
Let me know, Im happy to tweak this as long as it stays in line with the original goals
